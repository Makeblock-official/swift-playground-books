Shortly speaking, make Neuron do anything you can imagine. Also, you have the chance to get your paper cut-outs moving since a variety of Neuron projects are available in the Playgrounds, including Playing the Piano and Automatic Car. You can even build a robot here. Explore Neuron in the Playgrounds!",
